# WDI Vet Clinic

This is a simple Sinatra app to manage a set of pets and pet owners. It is intended to demonstrate how to use Sinatra to create a RESTful Wep Application that uses server side rendering.

## Technologies

* PostgreSQL
* Ruby
* Sinatra (with ERB for server side rendering)
* HTML
* CSS
* Twitter Bootstrap CSS

## How to Run

* Use the scripts in the `db` directory to create and populate a `vet-clinic` database.
* Use shotgun to run it:

```
shotgun sinatra-app.rb
```

## TODOs

* Improve the UI
